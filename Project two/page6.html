<p> X.com was the first online banking system.. and yep it was created by Elon Musk. If you are a little confused right now, would it help if I call it by its current name, 'PayPal?' Musk started this company and when it began to grow big, he got fired by the board - a very similar situation to what happened to Steve Jobs in the 80's. </p>
